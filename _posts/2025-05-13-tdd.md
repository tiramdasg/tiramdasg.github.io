<!-- # TDD: Writing Tests Before Code, Not Afterthoughts -->
Test-Driven Development (TDD) flips the usual dev flow on its head—and for good reason. Instead of coding first and testing later (if ever…), TDD starts with writing a test. Yeah, before a single line of actual functionality.

### How it Works (In Plain English)
1. Write a failing test: Define what your code should do by writing a test that (right now) fails because… well, the code doesn't exist yet.

2. Make it pass: Write just enough code to get that test to pass. No extras, no over-engineering.

3. Refactor: Clean up the code while keeping the test green. Rinse and repeat.

That’s it. Red → Green → Refactor.

### Why Bother?
At first, TDD feels like you're walking with shoelaces tied. But here's why it’s worth the weirdness:

- Fewer bugs: Tests are baked in from the start.

- Cleaner architecture: You write only what’s needed—nothing more.

- Refactoring confidence: You can safely tweak code without the fear of breaking things.

- Self-documenting code: Your tests explain what the code does.

### TDD in the Wild
It shines in backend logic, APIs, and anything with clear input-output behavior. Not so much in early UI prototyping—unless you love testing CSS transitions (bless your heart if so).

### Pro Tip
Don’t let TDD become a ritual. It's a tool, not a religion. Use it where it adds value.
