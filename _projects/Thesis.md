# Developing CAN (Control Area Network) Intrusion detection System (IDS) using Machine Learning with Datasets based on Real Life Traffic Scenarios
**Dec 2024 â€” Jun 2025**

More details soon.

## What I Learned:
Through this project, I learned how to work independently, effectively managing my responsibilities as a working student while balancing university studies along with being dedicated to the project. This experience taught me to be analytical, accountable and reliable, ensuring that I could meet all deadlines and deliver high-quality work despite the demands of multiple commitments.
