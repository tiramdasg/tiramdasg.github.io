# Developing an Intrusion detection System (IDS) for Control Area Networks (CAN) using Machine Learning based on Real Life Traffic Datasets
**Dec 2024 â€” Jun 2025**

More details soon.

## What I Learned:
Through this project, I learned how to work independently, effectively managing my responsibilities as a working student while balancing university studies along with being dedicated to the project. This experience taught me to be analytical, accountable and reliable, ensuring that I could meet all deadlines and deliver high-quality work despite the demands of multiple commitments.
